SSBackUp (Server Side BackUp) - BackUps Become Easy

SSBackUp (Server Side BackUp) performs full backups of your website and stores them in separate folder of your server. When backups are created you can easily download or delete them. You do not need a ftp client! All operations can be performed using SSBackUp. SSBackUp excludes previous backups during the backup so that the final backup is not too large. Backups are sorted by date so the last backup performed is the first on the list. You can exclude folders and/or change the default dates format. All functions are divided in modules (panels) so you can use them only if you need. An automated procedure helps you to have SSBackUp installed without particular technician skills.
